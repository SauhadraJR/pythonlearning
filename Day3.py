#Day 3 - Operators in python 

# a = "hello"
# b = 2

# print(a*b)  #Print the value of a, b times

# c = 2.8
# print(int(c))  #type conversion float to int

# print(type(a)) #to print the datatype



# a = ["hello", 23, "world"]

# a[0] = a[0] + " guys"

# print(a)



# a = ("hello", 23, "world")

# #a[0] = a[0] + " guys"  #not allowed in tuple, you cannot change the data in tuples

# print(a[1])

# Addition assignment operator(+=)
# a = 2
# a += 3      # a = a + 3

# print(a)    # prints the value of a i.e. 5


# Logical operators 

# And operator 

# a = 2
# b = 3
# c = 5

# d = b > a and b < c

# print(d)

# Or Operator

# d = b > a or b > c 

# print(d)

# Identity operator
# Is operator
# a = 2
# b = 2

# c = a is b 

# Is not operator

# d = a is not b 
# print(d)

# Membership operator

# In operator

a = [23]
b = [2,3,23]

c = a[0] in b
d = a in b
print(c)
print(d)
